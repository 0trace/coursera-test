                            The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of
                            domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl
                            (Gallus gallus). It is one of the most common and
                            widespread domestic animals, with a total population
                            of more than 19 billion as of 2011. There are more
                            chickens in the world than any other bird or
                            domesticated fowl. Humans keep chickens primarily
                            as a source of food (consuming both their meat and
                            eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised
                            for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
                            were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period
                            (4th–2nd centuries BC).

                            Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle,
                            particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating
                            beef since prehistoric times. Beef is a source of
                            high-quality protein and nutrients.

                            Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯꜜɕi] or [sɯɕiꜜ])
                            is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯
                            sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt,
                            accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ neta),
                            such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical
                            fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary
                            widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice",
                            also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).
                            The term sushi is no longer used in its original
                            context; it literally means "sour-tasting".
